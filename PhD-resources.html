            <!-- end title -->
 
<p> Doing a PhD can be challenging for the uncertainty and precarity of your situation; the environment you will be in (e.g. if you are in a new city, in a competitive environment, etc.); and mostly it will be challenging because writing a thesis is difficult! <br />
            Your university will have training events and resources to help you deal with some of the common difficulties: time management, project management, presenting, publishing, writing the thesis, understanding the structure of a PhD, etc. 
            For example, here you can access support <a href="https://docservice.uni-graz.at/de/" target="_blank">at the University of Graz</a>.
</p>         
            <p>Typically, the challenges will also vary depending not only on your situation, but also the phase of the PhD you are in: at the beginning, there will be the challenge of understanding 'how it all works'; then, there might be a phase in which your enthusiasm is gone, and you will be alone struggling with the difficulties of your research and questioning all your choices (also known as 'second year blue'); 
                afterwards you will be in an intense working routine, writing up the thesis (with the challenges writing entails); and finally you will be worrying about your defence and exploring your career possibilities.
                There are a lot of online resources dealing with all these and other challenges, and this section lists some of them.</p>
<p>The two biggest online resources for your PhD, will probably be these two blogs:
 <ul>
     <li><a href="https://thesiswhisperer.com" target="_blank">The Thesis Whisperer</a>, this blog by Dr Inger Mewburn has been active for over 10 years and it is a classic reference for a range of PhD experiences, tools, and advice (including downloadable resources). For example, <a href="https://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/05/08/the-valley-of-shit/" target="_blank">the valley of s**t</a> is a post which has been vastly popular.</li>
     <li><a href="https://patthomson.net" target="_blank">Patter</a>, by Prof Pat Thomson this is the best reference for academic writing, and it has over 10 years of posts covering various aspects of writing the thesis, papers, and dealing with writing challenges.</li>
 </ul></p>
   <p>Besides, there are multiple other established blogs which might be helpful:         
<ul>            
    <li><a href="https://www.evalantsoght.com" target="_blank">Eva Lantsoght's blog</a>, who has been blogging about various aspects of doing a PhD for more than 10 years (there are also some posts on the postdoctoral phase).</li>
     <li><a href="https://thedigitaldoctorate.com/author/thedigitaldoctorate/" target="_blank">The Digital Doctorate</a>, by Paul Spencer, covering a range of topics in research development</li>
     <li<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/users/gradhacker" target="_blank">Grad Hacker</a>, this is focused on the US context, but deals with common challenges - often discussed by PhD students themselves.</li>
     <li><a href="https://doctoralwriting.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Doctoral Writing SIG</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://explorationsofstyle.com" target="_blank">Explorations of Style</a></li>

</ul></p>
            <p>And, of course, <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php" target="_blank">PhD Comics</a> is also a classic!</p>
