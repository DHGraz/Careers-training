        <h5>Writing is difficult</h5>
       <p>There are many resources for improving academic writing and keeping it going, when it becomes difficult.
           For example, this is  a recent post summarising many possible difficulties: <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/11/16/but-im-not-ready-common-barriers-to-writing-and-how-to-overcome-them/" target="_blank">“But I’m not ready!” Common barriers to writing and how to overcome them</a> (Hugh Kearns and Dr Maria Gardiner, 2020 - adapted from previous posts).
           Managing the flow of writing can be challenging, and methods such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a> can help to keep a productive rhythm.
           While you will find plenty of advice online, remember that searching for solutions to a writing crisis can be a form of procrastination by itself - and you will often already know yourself and tricks that help you focus.</p>
      <p>Since writing can be a lonely activity, and the lack of accountability compounded with the difficulties of writing can make it challenging, there has been a growth in group writing initiatives, which you can find at your institution (if you check the University of Graz event newsletter, they regularly host sections for PhD students), or online - under the labels (and hashtags) 'Shut Up and Write' or #acwri (=academic writing). 
          November is also the #acwrimo (=academic writing month), during which there are more initiatives for shared writing slots.</p>
        <p>In regards of the structure of a piece of writing, the style, and the language there are also many resoruces. The most useful at PhD level is surely the already mentioned <a href="https://patthomson.net" target="_blank">Patter</a>.</p>
        
        <h5>Notes on journal articles</h5>
            <p>The choice of a journal to which to submit an article depends on a few factors: most importantly, which journal does best fit that type of research? In order to decide it helps reflecting on the type of topics covered by a journal, seeing where the authors we are citing in that article have published similar work, and considering how publishing in that journal would attract the readership we want to have.</p>
        <p>When looking for publishing open access (which is required by most funders), there is need to check whether the journal supports green open access (pre-prints can be uploaded in institutional repositories) and/or golden open access (open access for everyone, but the authors have to pay a fee). The open access costs can often be included in a grant budget or there might funding support for open access publications, e.g. the University of Graz has a funding stream for it.
            It is important to be aware also of predatory journals, which are in most cases included in the <a href="https://beallslist.net" target="_blank">Beall's list</a> of potential preadory journals and publishers.
        
        <h5>Research project applications</h5>
            <p>As mentioned in the <a href="Postdoc-Funding.html" target="_blank">Finding Funding</a> section, there are many different funders and each one will have its own application guidelines. When applying for funding, checking eligibility requirements and whether your project could work with that particular funding call is the first step. Subsequently, studying the application guidelines and checking what structure the application should have is also important, so that you know how to prepare your material. 
            For example, you will find that some funders ask you to directly address themes in the call and demonstrating how your project is contributing to solve specific problems (e.g. in some EU funding calls), whereas other funders let you follow your own research questions and you need to demonstrate their importance. Similarly, CV formats can be different between different funders, so it is helpful to keep a CV with everything you do, and updated templates for the most common formats (e.g. the FWF one).</p> 
            <p>There is a lot of advice online on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03914-5" target="_blank">Secrets to writing successful grant applications</a>, and the Research Office of the University will be able to help. However, it is even more helpful to start participating in the process of writing grants early on, so to get some experience before you will have to apply independently. 
            Therefore getting involved in funding application already during your MA, so to have a look at what they entail, and contributing to them in a more substantial way during your PhD, when you still have the possiblity of having lot of support from your supervisor or PI, is a great way to getting started in this specific form of writing. At ZIM, you can do so by asking to participate when we discuss new potential applications and you can propose your ideas for projects and discuss them with the others.
            Once you are close to finish your PhD or in the early phases of your postdoc, you can also consider attending workshops organised by funders at conferences or training events funders and universities might organise: for example, the FWF organises workshops in Vienna (and less often also in Graz) in which you get an overview of their programmes and evaluation process, and the opportunity to see and discuss actual applications (which researchers have generously allowed to use for training purposes).</p>
