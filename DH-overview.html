            <p>Digital humanities researchers can have a background in a variety of fields: there are researchers with humanities degrees that have progressively adopted digital methods; there are researchers coming from computer sciences and media studies; and after the establishment of the first PhD programme for digital humanities (at King's College London in 2005), since the 2010s there has been a continous increase in DH curricula, contributing to the establishment of the discipline. 
            Similarly, DH researchers can follow a 'traditional' academic path; can develop careers as research technologists and digital specialists in research support units; and can access a range of possibilities outside of universities.</p>
            
           While the steps in an academic career are described in other sections of this website, here it might be worth highlighting two aspects of a DH academic career:
           <ul>
               <li>Disciplinary affiliation: both in terms of background and in terms of institutional affiliation. Although DH departments and centres are being increasingly created in a lot of universities, some DH researchers might find jobs in other humanities departments (e.g. history, literature, languages) and will need to grow a DH research focus in the university from there.</li>
               <li>DH outputs and 'traditional' academic outputs. Research evaluations still tend to privilege the publication of journal articles (or monographs) to the development of complext digital projects (especially in the case of digital infrastructures).</li>
           </ul>
            
            <p>There are also different national policies in regards of DH, affecting the habilitation, funding, and evaluation of DH research. You can find the Austrian situation summarised in the slides on this <a href="https://dha.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/sites/default/files/events/attachments/mayer-studie_dh_in_oesterreich.pdf">Study on DH in Austria (Katja Mayer, 2020)</a>. As for the German speaking area, you can see the growth of DH professorships in this list, <a href="https://dhd-blog.org/?p=11018">Professuren für Digital Humanities</a>, compiled by Patrick Sahle.</p>
            
           <p>In parallel to traditional academic paths, DH researchers are employed in universities also in digital teams affiliated with libraries, IT support, or research development units. Here, researchers work as digital specialists or technologists, and provide training to academics and students (sometimes with series of short DH workshops/seminars), support and manage digital research outputs, and create 'labs' where other researchers can learn about, and experiment with, various equipment and software.</p>
            
            <p>Posts, publications, and debates on the position of DH specialists in alternative academic roles have been frequent in the last decade (or more!). For example, after the emergence of a debate around 'alt-ac', the postion of DH was discussed by Julia Flanders, in the chapter <a href="https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/769e1bc9-25c1-49c0-89ed-8580290b7695">'Time, Labor, and “Alternate Careers” in Digital Humanities Knowledge Work'</a> in <i>Debates in the Digital Humanities</i> (2012), which reflects on career paths for DH researchers, across diverse research and support roles in academia and outside.
                In 2018, <a href="https://talkinghumanities.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2018/07/10/we-need-to-talk-about-the-digital-humanities-job/">Dr James O’Sullivan wrote about 'the digital humanities job'</a>, discussing the challenges of DH researchers who are hired to 'develop DH' in an institution. A <a href="https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-4e08b137-aec5-49a4-83c0-38258425f145/section/db658807-141d-4911-b2d6-8e5682c8d08f#ch17">chapter on 'alt-ac' careers within universities</a> by Lisa Brundage, Karen Gregory, and Emily Sherwood offers a perspective on the type of training and work for these positions, and its gendered framing (with a focus on the US context). 
                Shawn Graham, now professor of DH at Carleton University (Canada) wrote about his career path and the challenges
                of becoming a DH scholar in <a href="https://thedigitalpress.org/failing-gloriously/">Failing Gloriously and Other Essays</a> (2019). 
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, DH skills can give you access also to a great set of roles in cultural institutions (museums, libraries, archives), in the private sector (e.g. as web developer), and as freelance (for example, collaborating on academic projects or with cultural institutions on a project basis).</p>
            
            <p>The best way for preparing yourself for a career in DH during your studies is to follow debates in the field, by joining mailing lists (where you can also see which jobs are advertised), reading blogs or online discussions, and following the work of DH associations. 
            For example, some associations you might follow are (note that this least includes international ones, but then focuses mainly on the European context):
