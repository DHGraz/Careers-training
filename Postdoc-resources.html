<p>During a PhD, a candidate will work on his/her thesis, present it at conferences, eventually publish in academic journals, develop some teaching experience, and work as research assistant on a few projects by senior researchers.
</p>
<p>After the PhD, a postdoc who decides to remain in academia will have to keep on developing his/her profile by keeping on presenting and publishing his/her research, teaching, and working on research projects. However, at postdoctoral level, these tasks will become increasingly important and broadened. 
Papers will draw on the PhD, but also on new projects the postdoc will be employed in, and new themes he/she will be exploring in his/her own research. There might be more teaching, and the postdoc might have to develop more new modules: preparing the material for these new modules will take up significant time. 
The postdoc, as mentioned in the previous section, might be employed on research projects led by another (more senior) researcher; but, at the same time, he/she will be trying to apply for funding for his/her own ideas and will be applying for other research jobs (given the short-term contracts of many research fellowships).
In addition, the postdoc might start supervising student dissertations, will increasingly participate in international networks and be invited to peer review for journals and conferences, and might have more admin responsibilities (e.g. as project manager). 
The variety of tasks and responsibilities will of course depend on the type of contract and institution the postdoc will be in, but in general time management, people management, and project management are key skills that will be developed further in the postdoc phase, alongside research skills and outputs.
