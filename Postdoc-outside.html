            <p>A PhD can lead also to great research roles outside of academia, and the skills you will have developed during the PhD can be applied in a range of roles and sectors. 
                Humanities PhD might work for research councils (e.g. the FWF in Austria); government; cultural institutions; or they can work as freelancers, for example contributing to research projects, writing reports, advising on methods and tools, etc. They can remain in universities and move to non-academic or support roles (e.g. grant writers, librarians, career development services).
                Many universities organise workshops on tranferrable skills, such as time management or writing skills, which are acquired during a PhD and can be valued by employers outside of academia. </p>
        
            <p><b>Resources</b>:
         <ul>
             <li>A good resource to get started is <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/advice/doing/phd-non-academic-careers.aspx" target="_blank">this post by FindAPhD</a>, which demonstrates how to translate the PhD experience into skills for a CV targeted at employers outside of academia, and includes also a list of further links.</li>
             <li>Targeted at historians: <a href="https://beyondacademe.com/index.html" target="_blank">Beyond Academe</a>, this is US-based (and dates to the early 2000s), but it contains a considerable list of resources, ideas, and links organised in a clearly way; some may be outdated, but in general this is a great starting point for historians (and nearby fields) considering possibilities in non-academic careers.</li>
             <li><a href="https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/career-development/researchers/career-orientation-tool" target="_blank">The career orientation tool</a> by Euraxess offers a clear summary of the possibilities after a PhD. You can further explore them by using their <a href="https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/node/459464/" target="_blank">Career Handbook</a> (you can see it as a pdf or use it via the e-tool)</li>
            <p></p> 
            <li>An example of transferrable skills PhDs will have is <a href="http://cheekyscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20-Transferable-Skills.pdf" target="_blank">20 Transferable Skills for PhDs</a> by <i>Cheeky Scientist</i>, which has a lot of resources on careers outside of academia. It is US-focused and science-focused, but the transferable skills they list are largely applicable also to humanities PhD.</li>
             <li><a href="https://versatilephd.com/phd-career-finder/" target="_blank">Versatile PhD</a> has a list of possible career paths for humanities PhDs (note: you will need to register, for free, to access the full content).</li>
             <li>Euraxess has also a section dedicated to jobs in outside of universities: <a href="https://www.euraxess.at/austria/research-austria/jobs-public-and-private-organisations" target="_blank">this is the page for Austria</a>, where you can see non-university research organisations and jobs in the public and private sector.</li>
             <li><a href="http://tracephd.com" target="_blank">Trace</a> was a project which tracked the careers of PhDs in Canada, and its website has many data, reflections, and interviews.</li>
             <li><a href="https://cdn5.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/domains/nl/which_grass_is_greener_cwts.pdf" target="_blank">Career stories from the Netherlands</a>: since most of the resources listed here come from the US/UK world, this link adds a perspective from the Netherlands.</li>
         </ul>
 </p>
 <p>Note that this page focuses in general on paths outside of academia for (mainly humanities) PhDs. Career paths specific for DH are explored in the DH section of the website.</p>
