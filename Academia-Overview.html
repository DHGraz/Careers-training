            <p>This section will give you an overview of the steps in an academic career and the different aspects of an academic job.</p>
 <p>There are significant differences between structures, policies, and organisation of academic work in different countries. However, at its basic an academic career is always based on three separate components: research, teaching, and service. In addition, in many countries and for many funders, impact is becoming increasingly important.<br />
     Similarly, despite differences in titles or conditions, an academic career is generally based on the same steps: students can begin to work on research projects during their MA, and subsequently decide to enroll in a PhD. PhD researchers can be funded in a variety of way and their programme might have different requirments (see section on PhD), but their main aim will always be the writing of a PhD thesis. 
     Once their thesis has been approved in a formal exam, they will become Doctor and move into the phase of postdocs. 
     Postdocs are faced by a multiplicity of career choices: they can decide to follow a research-focused path, a teaching path, a mix of the two, or to work in research outside of the university. 
     This tends to a be an uncertain and precarious phase for many resarchers, and in reality they might be employed on multiple contracts across all these paths. 
     After some years, they will become established in a career track; for those pursuing a professorship, this will begin with junior professor positions and gradually continue with associate professorships and full professorships. In certain countries a junior professor can become full professor within the same university, undergoing an internal evaluation; in other countries, there might be the need to apply for positions (if and when they open), to move institutions (e.g. Germany), or to submit formal 'tenure dossiers' (e.g. US).</p>
