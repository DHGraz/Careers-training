 <h5>Funding</h5>
 <p>
 In general, funding for a PhD can come in three main ways:
 <ul>
 <li><b>Funded PhD Programmes</b>, i.e. funding to support PhD candidates to work on their own PhD idea for a certain number of years. These programmes can be:
 <ul><li>Internal: universities can have a ‘PhD programme’ which supports new PhDs. Candidates who win this funding might have to work a certain number of hours for the institution in exchange.
 </li><li>External funders supporting PhD programmes: this funding will support PhD projects proposed by the candidates.
 </li></ul></li>
     <li><b>Funded research projects</b>: a postdoc/professor applies for funding for a research project, and includes in the project a PhD position (in this case, the PhD candidate will have to work on a specific topic, defined in the grant application for that project).
     </li>
     <li><b>Self-funded</b>: in this case, the candidate starts a PhD programme without any funding, and they will use their own resources to fund it (savings; loans; temporary jobs). In many cases, this might mean a combination of teaching contracts at the university, research assistant positions (on projects not necessarily related with the topic of the thesis), and jobs outside the university.
     </li></ul></p>

            <h5>Choosing an institution and a supervisor</h5>           
            <p>When you choose where to do a PhD, there might be different considerations – and this is certainly not a complete list, you will have your own priorities and interests, which you will need to consider. In general, the location, the supervisor, training resources, and funding possibilities are all factors to consider.</p>
            <p>An academic career rarely develops all in the same institution: you might be considering moving for your PhD or you might prefer staying in your city. On the one hand, some funders (e.g. Marie Curie ITN) will require you to move country in order to do a PhD. Moving might also be a chance of seeing how research is conducted in other institutions; to join a department or a supervisor whose research focus is closer to your interest; or to experience another context. On the other hand, personal relationships, family and caring responsibilities, as well as your personal preferences might prompt you to remain in your city. In this case, remember that you might always have the possibility of doing shorter visiting periods abroad during your PhD.</p>
            <p>The most important aspect is that your supervisor will be a crucial person in your work for the next 3-4 years and for the development of your career at large. It might be an academic you already know, perhaps your MA supervisor, or it might be a new academic in a new institution. In any case, you will have to consider your expectations and working styles (e.g. how your interest match; how often you will meet; who else can support you at the institution).</p>
            <p>The institution will have a series of career training resources, doctoral services and programmes, which enable you to get additional training, create a community with your peers, and get support throughout the PhD. These are all aspects that you can research on the university website, so to see which possibilities for career development you will have during the PhD.</p>
            <p>Finally, a lot depends also on funding. There might be an institution with a strong PhD programme; there might be a supervisor who has just won a big grant and is advertising a PhD position in the area you want to work on; or there might be the possibility of having a teaching job or a research contract while working on your thesis.</p>
            
            <h5>Choosing a topic</h5>
            When you choose to do a PhD, you will have contacted your potential supervisor with a research idea and discussed it with him/her (unless you are applying for a position on a research project with an already established topic). Your initial research idea, or the topic established in a funded project, will form the basis of your PhD proposal – on the basis of this, you will be admitted to the programme. However, the topic might slightly change the more you develop your research and you start to get more familiar with the literature and your data. 
            
            In a way, the process of developing your topic has been famously illustrated by <a href=http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/> Matt Might in this graphic</a>.

            <h3>Doing a PhD at the University of Graz</h3>
           <p>The University of Graz gives you the possibility of doing a PhD: <ul>
                <li><a href="https://docservice.uni-graz.at/de/rund-um-die-betreuung/individuelles-doktorat/">by working independently with a supervisor</a>: in this case, your experience will depend on which supervisor and department you will be in, which funding sources you will find, and how prepared and disciplined you are in working independently.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://docservice.uni-graz.at/de/rund-um-die-betreuung/strukturiertes-doktorat/">by joining a structured PhD</a>, during which you will be part of a cohort and you will be participating in a series of activities, which will help you to keep in touch with your peers and keep motivated during the PhD. In turn, a structured PhD can be of three types:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://doctoral-academy.uni-graz.at/de/">Doctoral Academy</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://docservice.uni-graz.at/de/rund-um-die-betreuung/strukturiertes-doktorat/doktoratsschulen/">Doctoral School</a>(note that unfortunately there is not a school for the humanities)</li>
                                    <li><a href="https://docservice.uni-graz.at/de/rund-um-die-betreuung/strukturiertes-doktorat/doktoratsprogramme/">Doctoral Programme</a>: these are interdisciplinary networks, focused around research themes. For example, the Human Factor in Digital Transformation programme includes staff and students from ZIM.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
            </ul>
           </p>
            <p>In addition, the Doc Services and other internal training groups (e.g. Methods Competence centre) offer a range of workshops and advice sessions.</p>
            <p>A PhD at the University of Graz can be funded in four main ways:<ul>
                <li>as a research assistant employed directly by the university, in which case those positions will be advertised on the university's jobs portal.</li>
                <li>as a research assistant on third party funded projects, in which case your department will hire you to work on a research projects - in this case, you can work a maximum of 30hours/week (75%).</li>
                <li>FWF doctorate programmes, which are funded by the FWF for four years.</li>
                <li>bursary, which could be won by researchers individually.</li>
                <li>self funding, by working outside the university.</li>
            </ul>
                You can find more information, with links to current opportunities, <a href="https://docservice.uni-graz.at/de/finanzierung/">on the University's website</a>.
