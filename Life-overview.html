            <p>At every stage in an academic career, researchers will be working on three main 'tasks': research, teaching, and service. Research impact and communication have emerged recently as a fourth important component of academic work.</p>
            
           <p>The balance between these components varies during an academic career. <b>PhD students</b> will mostly be focused on research (indeed, you will often hear senior academics saying that a PhD is the only time you can fully devote yourself to research!), 
               with eventual added teaching (if it is part of their bursary or if they seek a teaching job to support their studies). They might be in charge of small service tasks, e.g. organising a seminar series or doing their first peer reviews; and there is an increasing attention to raising one's own profile, for example on social media.
               Depending on the path they choose, <b>postdocs</b> might have primarily teaching or research tasks. In the case they are working on research projects, they might have more admin responsibilities or they might have be responsible of supervising MA students and PhDs assistants. 
           They will become increasingly involved in societies, conference committees, journal editorial boards, and they will be invited to act as peer reviewers on an increasing number of conferences or journal papers. In order to obtain funding, they will have to demonstrate the potential impact of their research and submit communication plans as part of their research funding application.
               <b>Professors</b> will have more teaching, including the supervision of PhD thesis; more admin roles and responsibilities both at university level and in academic societies, journals, and conferences; they will be regularly asked to provide peer reviews, references, liaise with potential research partners and applicants - in short, more emails! 
               In the UK, they will be directly evaluated for their research impact (it constitutes 25% of the British periodical university evaluation, called REF); in all cases, demonstrating impact and disseminating research is increasingly important for funders (if the research is funded with public money, it should demonstrate a benefit for society).</p>
          <p> Being able to commmunicate one's research to a variety of audiences is important, and <b>science communication</b> has been growing constantly in the last two decades: we can find resources under the label '(digital) public humanities', '(digital) public history', 'public archaeoogy', etc. Science communication can happen in face-to-face events, e.g. the "Pint of Science" series of talks (where resarcheres present their research in pubs) or in dedicated events for families, children, local communities, etc. 
           Websites, social media, and interactive applications (including serious games - keyword 'gamification') have also become very important in these regards: between the mid-2000s and the early 2010s, there was an huge attention on blogging, which has in the mid-2010s declined in favour of social media (based on the idea that it was easier to get audiences' attention on those platform where they were already present). 
           In the last years, blogs have reemerged thanks to the growth of platforms for social journalism, such as Medium, and the development of initiatives such as <a href="https://theconversation.com/uk" target="_blank">The Conversation</a>, where researchers whose University is a partner can publish research-driven articles for a broader public.</p> 
            
            <p>Besides the importance of sharing with the public one's research, academics are also sharing it with peers - in order to raise attention on their work and, hopefully, citations. 
  The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish" target="_blank">Publish or Perish</a></b> situation, in which academics are pressurised in producing lots of publications, is very problematic (and there is a 'slow science' movement attempting to contrast it): the idea is that quantity does not entail quality and the pressure to publish leads to questionable practices (e.g. 'salami slicing') and results.
  Similarly, while researchers are still evaluated by a series of metrics (e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index" target="_blank">H-index</a>) or the Impact Factor of the journal they publish in (a reason - alongside with peer review - why journal articles are valued more than monographs in the sciences, and increasingly in the humanities), there is a long debate on the values of metrics. For example, the <a href="https://sfdora.org/read/" target="_blank">DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment)</a> already in 2012 raised the attention on the need to move away from such metrics. Still, a variety of metrics and altmetrics are still part of the everyday life of academics.</p>
  
  <p>The challenges of precarity and having likely to move often have been mentioned in the earlier section on academic careers. In practice, this can lead to some great aspects - such as living in different places, having friends in many different cities (although you will probably see them only if there is a conference nearby...), having a flexible schedule, the rewarding aspects of teaching the new generation of researchers, and the possiblity of following your research interests.
      On the other hand, an academic life has also negative aspects: most academics work 60+ hours week, which means working evenings and weekends on a regular basis. Unfortunately, in many systems, this is the only solution to manage the workload - and weekends are the only moment in which it is possible to focus on research without meetings or emails interrupting the work. As mentioned, calls for an healthier work/life balance are therefore very frequent, and mental health problems - especially for early career academics who need to cope also with their precarious job situation - are common.
      Having a global network is a great aspect of academia, but this means that sometimes researchers are alone working on their topic in their institution. Indeed, an academic can have days full of meetings and classes, followed by days of complete isolation. A simple Google Search on 'day in the life of a PhD/postdoc/professor' will give you plenty of examples about 'typical' working days at various stages of an academic career. </p>

<p>To conclude with a lighter note, if you decide to stay in academia, it is very likely that sooner or later someone would suggest you to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_(novel)" target="_blank">Stoner</a> (note: the link contains spoilers!), a 1965 novel by John Williams which is still enjoying a great attention: it is a lovely book, although be alerted that it is definetely not a feel-good story!</p>
