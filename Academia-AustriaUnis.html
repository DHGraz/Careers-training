            <p>This section will first cover the organisation of Austrian universities, presenting the main legislation and using the example of the University of Graz. Subsequently, it will focus on the career structure within the Austrian system.</p><p>There are different types of higher education institutions in Austria. As of the 1st September 2019 (<a href="https://www.bmbwf.gv.at/Themen/HS-Uni/Hochschulsystem.html">source BMBWF</a>), there were: 22 öffentliche Universitäten (= universities, medical universities, art schools), 21 Fachhochschulen (= professional qualifications), 14 Pädagogische Hochschulen (= preparation of teachers), 16 Privatuniversitäten (= private universities). This section will focus on universities, including medical ones and art schools (Öffentliche Universitäten).
</p>
            <h5>Universit&aumltsgesetz 2002</h5>
            <p>Universities are regulated by the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=20002128">Universit&aumltsgesetz 2002</a> (UG). This legislation covers funding, organisation, student regulation, and personnel regulation. In addition, each university can add its own regulations and organise its units.</p>
            <p><b>Funding</b></p>
            <p>The universities negotiate a <a href="https://www.bmbwf.gv.at/Themen/HS-Uni/Hochschulgovernance/Steuerungsinstrumente/Leistungsvereinbarungen.html">'Leistungsvereinbarungen' (service agreement)</a> with the Ministry of Research and Education (BMBWF = Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung) every three years. This agreement includes a set of objectives and services the university will provide in the following three years, and the amount of financial support by the government. The objectives cover:
            <ul>
                <li>Strategic objectives, profile development, staff development</li>
                <li>Research objectves, with definition of the core research fields for each university</li>
                <li>Teaching offer and development of the teaching portfolio (incuding further development courses, i.e. 'Weiterbildung'). This includes also setting student numbers (for close number courses).</li>
                <li>Strategy for countering student dropouts (i.e. students who leave before completing their courses).</li>
                <li>Improvement of the quality of mentoring.</li>
                <li>Support for students who are also working.</li>
                <li>Contribution to society (inclusion of women in leadership roles, knowledge-transfer, collaboration with external actors, social impact).</li>
                <li>Internazionalisation and mobility.</li>
                <li>Cooperation with other universities and higher education institutions (Hochschuleinrichtungen).</li>
                <li>Indicators for evaluating success in this service agreement.</li>
                <li>Measures when the university fails to reach the targets in this agreement.</li>
            </ul></p>
<p>During this negotiation, it is also established how much funding the government will provide for the next three years.</p>

            <p><b>Organisation</b></p>
            
            <p>UG 2002 establishes that universities are internally regulated by four organs:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Universit&aumltsrat</b>: this is an organisation overseeing the university. It is elected every fives years and it includes members selected by the senate, the BMBWF, and by its own members; members should be <U>external</U> to the university. It is responsible for the approval of the development plan of the university (which covers research, teaching, and service aims), the organisation plan (covering staff development), and the draft of the service agreement which will be proposed to the BMBWF; it chooses the Rektor (from a trio proposed by the Senat).</li>
                    <li><b>Rektorat</b>: this is the operative core of the university. It develops the development and organsation plans (then approved by the Universit&aumltsrat); it selects the heads of the various organisational units; it approves courses, budgets, research projects. Members of the Rektorat are chosen by the Rektor after his/her election; they do not need to have been previously employed by the university.</li>
                    <li><b>Rektor</b>: the Rektor is elected every four years. He/she concludes the service agreement with the BMBWF; he/she is the head of all the university personnel and approves all the employment contracts. He/She selects the Vizerektoren, which should be maximum four.</li>
                    <li><b>Senat</b>: this organisation is elected every three years, and it represents all the staff of the university. It translates into practice the development and organisation plan, and the decisions of the Universit&aumltsrat. It contributes to the election of the Rektor and of the Universit&aumltsrat. It approves curricula for new courses, or changes to curricula of existing courses. It selects the commissions for the examination of Habilitation and for the hiring of professors.</li>
                </ul>          
            </p>
            <p>In addition, UG 2002 establishes that there should be an office for equality (<b>Arbeitskreis für Gleichbehandlungsfragen</b>), responsible for countering discrimination due to sex, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, political views. Since 2015, there should be a quote of 50% of women in the university's organisations. For this reason, this office participates also in job committees.
                Another commission established by this legislation is the Arbitration one (<b>Schiedskommission</b>), which manages internal conflicts and discrimination cases.</p>
            
                <p><b>Student regulation</b></p>
           <p>UG 2002 has also set the legislation for students and university courses. For example, it aligns Austrian universities with the Bologna Process (180 ECTS for a Bachelor; 120 ECTS for a Master) and it regulates the recognition of dissertations and master across universities. 
               Each University will further develop its studies regulations (Studienrecht) within this framework.</p>
            
            <p><b>Personnel regulation</b></p>
            <p>UG 2002 regulates the employment conditions of all university staff. The most important document in this context is the 'Collective contract' ('Kollektivvertrag für die ArbeitnehmerInnen der Universitäten'), which is regularly updates and regulates the type of positions and renumeration for academic and administrative personnel in an university. You can find the current version of the KV <a href="https://www.uniko.ac.at/organisation/dachverband/kollektivvertrag/">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h5>The example of the University of Graz</h5>
            <p>You can explore the structure of the University of Graz from its website:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://strategische-entwicklung.uni-graz.at/de/">The development plan and its strategy</a>.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.uni-graz.at/de/die-universitaet/die-universitaet-graz/forschungsprofil/">Its core research fields</a>: Climate Change Graz, BioHealth, Complexity of Life in Basic Research and Innovation (COLIBRI), Smart Regulation, Dimensionen der Europäisierung.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.uni-graz.at/de/die-universitaet/die-universitaet-graz/organisation-struktur/">Its organisation and structure</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
               <p>The <a href="https://static.uni-graz.at/fileadmin/portal/universitaet/Files/organigramm.pdf">organigramm</a> shows the three top units, Universit&aumltsrat, Rektorat (led by the Rektor), and Senat. In the case of Graz, currently the university has four Vice Rectors: for teaching, for research, for digitalisation, and for finances. <br />
               </p> 
               <p>There are six faculties: Katholisch- Theologische Fakultät; Rechtswissen- schaftliche Fakultät; Sozial- und Wirtschafts- wissenschaftliche Fakultät; Umwelt-, Regional- und Bildungs- wissenschaftliche Fakultät; Geisteswissenschaftliche Fakultät; Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät. <br />
                  Each faculty has a central 'Dekanat', responsible for its administration and development, and a series of academic units, which can be either 'Institute' (= departments) or 'Zentren' (= research centre). Pay attention that while in Austria 'Institute' are permanent department, in the English language they might correspont to temporary or smaller units. 'Zentren' are instead non-permanent units, and they are evaluated and reconsidered periodically (every 5 years). <br />
                  In addition, the 'Dienst- und Fachaufsicht Rektorat' includes another series of units: mostly, they include administrative units directly dipendent from the four Vizerektoren and focused on management tasks. In parallel, there are a series of Centres which are not affiliated with any Faculty, but cut across the university and are therefore managed by the Rektorat. <br />
                   Finally, besides the two units mandated by the UG 2002 (i.e. Arbeitskreis für Gleichbehandlungsfragen; Schiedskommission), there are a series of other units focusing on specific administrative, management, and support tasks:
                   <ul>
                       <li>Betriebsrat für das wissenschaftliche Universitätspersonal: union for academic staff</li>
                       <li>Betriebsrat für das allgemeine Universitätspersonal: union for non-academic staff</li>
                       <li>HochschülerInnenschaft an der Universität Graz: student union</li>
                       <li>Studiendirektor/in: director of studies, conciding with the VR for teaching</li>
                       <li>Betriebsausschuss: speaker of the unions</li>
                       <li>Ethikkommission: supporting ethical procedures in research</li>
                       <li>Datenschutz- beauftragte/r: data protection officer</li>
                       <li>Behindertenvertrauensperson: disability support</li>
                       <li>Vertrauensstelle für Konfliktsituationen: conflict resolution</li>
                   </ul>
</p>
            <p>All the regulations and decisions taken by the university needs to be recorded, according to UG 2002, in public documents: for example, <a href="https://mitteilungsblatt.uni-graz.at/de/">the 'Mitteilungsbl&aumltter'</a> by the University of Graz reports its study and personnel regulations.</p>
