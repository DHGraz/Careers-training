            <h3>Factors to consider when thinking of doing a PhD</h3>
            <p> 
                If you enjoyed working on your MA dissertation, and you would like to continue doing research, you might be considering doing a PhD. It is a big decision and - as every decision - it has its pros and cons. There could be many reasons to do a PhD: better job possibilities (inside or outside academia), interest for a research question, the freedom of exploring in-depth a problem for a few years, titles, etc. While all these are valid reasons, your motivation will need to sustain you during the challenges that a PhD can pose.
            </p><p>
                Doing a PhD allows you focusing for a few years on a specific topic, which you will become an expert in. The interest for a field of research and the opportunity to explore it in-depth are great motivations for a PhD. At the same time, though, waking up every day with the same enthusiasm for the same small topic for 3-5 years will also be a challenge. Even more so, considering that in a PhD you have a lot of flexibility on when to work: choosing your own working hours is a great advantage, but it also requires you to be able to find your own motivation for working every day towards your thesis. Inevitably, there will be difficult moments, and you will need self-discipline and hard work to get through the highs and lows of a PhD.
            </p><p>
                A lot of the work you will be doing during your PhD will be unseen and apparently unrewarded: there will be multiple drafts of each subchapter of your thesis, there will be hours preparing your digital edition or analysing your data - but you (and, at times, your supervisor) will be the only one to see these little steps. You might present at conferences and publish some articles during your PhD, but all your work will come together only at the end, in the thesis you will submit. So, a PhD requires also a lot of patience to complete this ‘marathon’. If you prefer shorter projects with immediate feedbacks and rewards, a PhD could turn out a frustrating experience.
            </p><p>
                A PhD is a unique opportunity to develop your expertise in an area: almost no other job allows you this freedom of researching some topic without the constant pressure of deadlines and parallel tasks. However, this means that you will be exploring your topic alone – you will not have classmates and colleagues working on the same material at your same pace. In this sense, you might feel lonely in your research and you might struggle with all the new material you will encounter. Your supervisor will support you, but you might meet with him/her to discuss your progresses less often than what you did with your MA teachers. Resilience will be necessary to overcome the research challenges – as well as to overcome rejections and negative feedback you might encounter in conferences or publishing.
            </p><p>
                In short, self-discipline, working hard, patience, resilience, and motivation are key to complete a PhD – and much more important than ‘intelligence’ (in whatever way you want to define it). 
            </p>
            <p>Another fact worth mentioning is that it is still common to hear that a PhD will lead to a professorship: this idea unfortunately leads to many headaches and disappointments, since the job market is extremely competitive and it is unrealistic to start a PhD with the only aim of becoming a professor. On average, only a very small percentage of PhDs will end up working in academia, depending on which data we look at 2-5% of PhD graduates will end up in permanent academic roles. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Unique opportunity to focus in-depth and with total freedom on a research topic</li>
                <li>Independent and flexible work: you decide your own time-schedule</li>
                <li>Being part of an international research community</li>
                <li>Contributing to solve problems and improve knowledge</li>
                <li>Personal development</li>
                <li>Career development</li>

            <ul>
                <li>You might be the only one working on your topic in your institution, and this might contribute to feeling lonely in your research</li>
                <li>Without a fixed schedule, procrastination might become a problem not only in your work, but it might also affect other aspects of your life</li>
                <li>Conversely, there might be moments in which you will be working intensely on your thesis, and you will have to sacrifice other aspects of your life</li>
                <li>Possible lower pay than your colleagues who have chosen other career paths</li>
                <li>Precarity</li>
