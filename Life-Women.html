<p>Women in academia face a set of challenges, and while there are attempts to change structural inequalities, some of the other challenges are yet without a solution. 
    This section will focus on gender gap and bias issues; there are many other equality and diversity challenges in academia, due to sexual identities, gender identities, ethnic origin, disabilities. Interesectionality (a term created by Kimberl&eacute; Crenshaw in 1989) is the theoretical framework which looks at the interconnected nautre of these categorisations, so that - for example and simplifying - black faculty faces many challenges in becoming full professors; women face challenges in becoming full professors; black women face both these gender and race discriminations. 
    This section will include further links to explore these themes, which - in DH - are often found under the 'Global DH' or 'intersectional DH' labels. 
</p>
            
<p>The so-called 'leaky pipeline', which is the fact that there are equal - if not higher - number of women at MA students, PhD students, and in early postdoc level, but then the percentage of women drastically decreases at senior position levels is a well known problem, which various policies try to address. A summary of statistics on the gender gap in academia across the world (as of January 2020) can be seen here: <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-academia/">Quick Take: Women in Academia (2020)</a>. <br /> 
    <img src="img/leakypipelineEU.png" /><br />
    Source: an EU study by LERU on <a href="https://www.leru.org/files/implicit-bias-in-academia-full-paper.pdf">Implicit bias in academia</a>.<br />   
    In Austria, the gender mainstreaming policy and the gender officers within university aims to support appointments by women in research and senior positions - and the percentage of men/women at various career stages is regularly monitored by the Ministry of Education and Research.</p> 
   
<p>Besides, the precarity of early career researchers also affects family life. On the one hand, there might be long-distance relationships and - in the case of academic couples - the two-body problem (the challenge of finding jobs in the same university/area). 
    On the other hand, if women want to have children, they might need to decide between having them before getting a permanent contract (which might mean they would not have access to maternity pay and might make it difficult to come back to academia) or wait until getting tenure (which might happen too late to have children). 
    There are policies in support of women, which 'pause the clock' so that the parental leave period is considered as an interruption of scholarly activity and accounted for in time limits. For example, the FWF (Austrian Science Fund) START grant for early career researchers includes in its guidance that "Proven time spent raising children will be considered as interruptions to scientific/scholarly activity and up to three years will be allowed per child cared for by the applicant" (<a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/fileadmin/files/Dokumente/Antragstellung/START-Programm/y_application-guidelines.pdf">p.4</a>).
    In this way, women can take time off to have a family, thus ending up with a CV less rich than those of their peers who continue to work, and this will be not detrimental for their funding chances afterwards.
</p>
            
<p>However, women still faces many biases which makes them less secure and confident in contract negotiations (leading to pay gaps), but also in applying for jobs, where women tend not to apply unless they fulfill all criteria, whereas men apply more and present themselves more confidently. 
    This difference in approaches is refleced also in writing publications and research funding applications, as well as everyday communications (a tip women will hear a lot is to stop saying 'sorry!' when sending a normal email).
    The use of language is also gendered and <a href="https://csw.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/avoiding_gender_bias_in_letter_of_reference_writing.pdf">letters of recommendation for women</a> can reflect gender bias (there is even a <a href="http://slowe.github.io/genderbias/">calculator</a> for it).
</p> 

<p>Besides applications, women face gender bias in many ways in academia: their skills and capacity is regularly questioned, whereas men are perceived as 'experts'. This is reflected in research settings and in meetings, where women's contributions are underplayed and ignored in favour of men's ones: being ignored and being mansplained is part of every woman's academic experience.
    Teaching evaluations constitutes an important document in tenure processes and in internal university evaluation: however, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/feb/13/female-academics-huge-sexist-bias-students?CMP=share_btn_fb">students rate women worse than men</a> in teaching evaluation. 
    In relation to students, women tend to be delegated more pastoral care responisibilities than men - and similarly they tend to be assigned more caring responsibilities and 'housekeeping' tasks in their departments.
    This division of labour, based on gender biases of 'what women are good at', means that women often sacrifice time for their own research in dealing with these unequally distributed tasks.</p>
<p>Gender biases affect also the perceived 'expertise' and 'authority' of women, so that their research tends to be less cited and used. In this sense, there have been calls for feminist citation practices (<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/living-a-feminist-life">Sara Ahmed</a> highlighted such practice in 2017). The Women's in Digital Archaeology group has compiled a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18LuQxqZYgG0XIYnhizfKJYd7Fz8gKZCn7uoE6qHBuIM/edit">list of publications</a> by women, so to promote their work.</p>
            
<p>Sexual harassment and violence is sadly also present in academia: the #metoo movement has contributed to reveal academic predators, and raise attention on this aspect which affect both students and academics (and not only women, of course). In 2017, there has been crowdsourced spreadsheet of sexual harassment episodes in academia (with a focus on archaeology), and there is an increased attention to these problems. A clarification note: in articles on this topic, you might find mentions of Title IX, which is the legislation regulating discrimination based on sex in US education.
  As in many other contexts, women need therefore to pay attention to their safety: there are support officers and processes in universities; at conferences, there will be someone to whom victims can talk confidentially (and it will be announced at the beginning of the conference or on the conference website). Of course, as in other contexts, other women will also be happy to share a taxi or walk together between places.</p>
