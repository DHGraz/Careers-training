<p>DH researchers can find employment also outside of tenure-track jobs (i.e. teaching and research jobs leading to professorships). Research data management, digital expertise, web development, etc. are skills that are needed at university level, to support researchers in different departments, as well as train students in using digital tools and methods in their research. 
For this reason, you will find digital humanities jobs affiliated with academic and research services, libraries, and digital labs. 
Researchers in these jobs have less career progression possibilities, but they can also focus on supporting the development of infrastructures and skills in their institutions, without the pressure to publish typical of 'traditional' academic roles.
</p>
  
<p>The MLA (Modern Language Association of America) committee on Information Technology has been producing guidelines on professionals issues related to digital humanities, including the evaluation of work in the 'alt-ac' paths of Digital Scholarship Specialists and Digital Humanities Librarian. 
They suggest that these paths can include combinations of these roles: Program Coordinator/Administrator; Teaching-Focused Scholar-Practitioners; Research and/or Teaching Support/Librarians; Researchers; Developers, and they evaluated <a href="https://infotech.mla.hcommons.org/2018/evaluating-digital-humanities-beyond-the-tenure-track-part-1-for-employees/">skills, needs, and 'evidence of success'</a> for digital humanities work in these areas.</p>

<p>The interest in the combination of digital equipment, methods, experimentation, communication, and 'maker' cultures has led to a growth of labs, which for example are at the core of a new special issue of DHQ <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/preview/index.html">Lab and Slack. Situated Research Practices in Digital Humanities</a> (November 2020) and a forthcoming book (Routledge 2021).</p>

<p>Here some examples of DH labs:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://dhlab.yale.edu/about.html">Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab), a unit of Yale University Library</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/support-units">Duke University DH support units</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/digital-humanities-lab">Digital Humanities Lab at Rutgers</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk">King's Digital Lab</a>, at King's College London, and closely working with the Digital Humanities department</li>
    <li><a href="https://dig.hum.uu.nl">Utrecht Digital Humanities Lab</a></li>
</ul></p>

These discussions can be found also under the 'alt-ac' label. For example, this is a reflection from 2010 on such roles by Bethany Nowviskie: <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2010/alt-ac/#more-403">#alt-ac: alternate academic careers for humanities scholars</a>.
