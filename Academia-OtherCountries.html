            <p>This section includes links for discovering more about academic careers in different countries and general resources for news and career development in academia. The differences at each career stage will be highlighted also in the sections dedicated to PhDs, Postdocs, Professorships, Resarch Technicians, and the situation of DH.</p>
            <h5>General resources</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To have an overview of various career paths in different countries, I recommend the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory" target="_blank">Observatory of Academic Careers</a>: it is slighty outdated, but it is a comprehensive resource which helps in understanding different contexts.    
                </li>
   <li>
       The 'League of European Resarch Universities' (LERU) has produced diagrams showing <a href="https://www.leru.org/academic-career-maps-in-europe" target="_blank">Academic Career Maps</a> for some European countries (Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom). 
   </li>             
                <li>The <a href="https://academiccareermaps.org" target="_blank">Academic Pathways Across Countries</a> project is an H2020 project developing a glossary and an inventory of academic positions and titles across Europe.</li>
            <li>
                Note that there is also a Wikipedia category for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_ranks" target="_blank">Academic Ranks</a>, which list the career paths in about 90 countries.                
            </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com" target="_blank">Times Higher Education</a> is one of the main newspapers for academia, you can read a few free articles per month. Although from the UK, it covers global news in higher education. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Career advice and overviews for different countries on '<a href="https://academicpositions.com/career-advice" target="_blank">Academic Positions</a>'.        
                </li>
            </ul>
          
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <h5>Country-specific resources</h5>           
            <p></p>  
            The following resources include websites with news articles or career advice. These could be a starting point for researching different Higher Education systems: the differences include government funding for universities, use of acronyms, research evaluaton systems, titles and details of different academic roles, etc.
            <p></p>       <p>For example, to work in the UK, you will need to know what the REF and TEF are, or you might encounter assumptions and comments about the Russell Group (a  self-defined group of 24 research intensive universities) and post-92 universities (ex-polytechnics). In this case, the REF (Research Excellence Framework) is the government process for evaluating universities and assigning funding for the next cycle. Until 2008 it was called RAE (Research Assessment Exercise); the first REF cycle concluded in 2014 (covering the period 2008-2013), currently the 2021 REF is underway. It is based on three criteria: research outputs (=publications), research impact (=benefit for society, knowledge exchange), research environment (=stats and ratio of active researchers). Every academic has to prepare for it, results are grouped by departments, subjet units, and overall university. Research outputs are graded in five levels: four star (4* = world-leading), three star (3* = internationally excellent), two star (2* = international quality), one star (1* = national quality), unclassified quality (not meeting the criteria). It is important for ECR (Early Career Researchers) to be aware of that, since the potential for a  REF submission is considered in job applications. The
                TEF (Teaching Excellence Framework) is a recent introduction, which aims to evaluate teaching quality across universities. There will be similar gergo and assumptions in any country: if you are applying for a job, you will need to get an understanding of these national discourses.</p>
