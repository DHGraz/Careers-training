            This section includes links to websites where to look for DH jobs, and a couple of resources on the DH job market.
            
            <h5>Job Market advice</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://hcommons.org/groups/academic-job-market-support-network/">Academic Job Market Support Network</a> (on Humanities Commons) includes a lot of sample cover letters, CVs, applications, and job market advice.</li>
                <li>This <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/dh-cover-letters//">post on cover letters</a> by Brandon Walsh and Amanda Visconti offers a look at cover letters for DH jobs, with two sample letters annotated in details.</li>
                <li>This is a <a href="https://github.com/m-n-hannah/Digital-Humanities-Job-Market/blob/master/index.md">useful collection</a> of links and resources for a DH job search.</li>
            </ul>
                         
            <h5>Academic jobs</h5>
            <p>These websites are academic jobs portals in general, including - of course - all types of academic jobs in DH.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.euraxess.at">EU academic jobs</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.jobs.ac.uk">UK academic jobs</a>. You will find DH roles mostly under the 'Information Management and Librarianship' tag, but it is worth checking also under history and philosophy, languages and culture, and media and communication.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.academictransfer.com/en/">Dutch academic jobs</a>. You will find DH roles under 'Language and culture'.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.academics.com">German, Swiss, Austrian academic jobs</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/#tab-job-type">Times Higher Education</a> jobs portal.</li>        
            </ul>
            <p>Sometimes, DH jobs can also end up on mailing lists for other disciplines: for example, Chiara found her current job at ZIM on a website for cultural heritage academic jobs. So, it is worth considering also what 'traditional' discipline you see yourself most close to, and look at lists for that specific discipline.</p>
            <p></p>
            
            <h5>Academic jobs in DH</h5> 
            <p>These websites, by professional networks, include only jobs in DH.</p>

            </ul>
            <p></p>
            
            <h5>Outside of academia</h5>
            <p>There are a range of possible career paths for DH specialists outside of academia, such as in heritage institutions or in industry. As a first example, this list of <a href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/job-categories/computing-technology-and-digital">possible careers in 'Computing, technology and digital'</a>, from a website by the UK Government, shows the variety of paths that might be of interest. By clicking on each type of career, you will get a short overview: although most of it is focused on the UK context (e.g. pay, education), it might be interesting to explore the range of skills and the tasks entailed by these jobs.</p>
