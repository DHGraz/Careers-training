            This section will first offer an overview of the funding possibilities reserved only for ECRs and then cover funding sources available also to more senior researchers. It should be noted that there is not a consistent definition of ECRs across funding bodies, so this should be checked every time in the funding calls: an Early Career Researcher can define a researcher within 5-7 years of his/her PhD award, but those dates can change (and the reference to the end of the PhD can also be interpreted differently by different funding bodies).
            
            <h5>Funding for ECRs in the EU</h5>
            There are two main types of funding available to ECRs in Europe:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en">Marie Curie Fellowships</a>: these grants finance projects of two years (if carried out in Europe) or up to three years (if outside of Europe). The characteristic of this funding is a mobility requirement: you need to move to another country in order to develop a Marie Curie project.</li>
                <li><a href="https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants">ERC (European Research Council) Starting Grant</a>: up to 1,5 million € for a period of five years.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Both these funding calls are very competitive. ERC grants are the most prestigious grants in Europe and they will allow you to negotiate a permanent contract in most institution. You might encounter guidance and comments on ERC in various resources and workshops on preparing for them are regularly held at national level (in Austria, by the FFG) and during conferences. Pay attention that there are three types of ERC for individual researchers: Starting Grant (2 to 7 years of experience after the PhD); Consolidator Grant (7 to 12 years of experience after the PhD); Advanced Grant (more than 12 years of experience after the PhD). In addition, ERC Synergy Grants are awarded to groups of researchers.
            
            <h5>Funding for ECRs in Austria</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/forschungsfoerderung/fwf-programme/esprit-programm">FWF ESPRIT</a>: starting in April 2021, it is the new funding for ECR, calculated as 5 years from the date of the PhD; it funds projects of up to 3 years, covering the stipend of the researchers and up to 25.000 € for other project costs per year. In this sense, it is similar to the PhD fellowships existing in other countries (see below). It will also supersede the current Lise-Meitner and Hertha-Firnberg programmes.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/forschungsfoerderung/fwf-programme/zukunftskollegs">Zukunftskolleg (Young Research Groups)</a>: this funding will support young researcher groups of 3 to 5 researcher, who should be 1 to 5 years post-PhD. The funding is for 4 years, and researchers should be working across a minimum of two departments (or institutions) on an interdisciplinary project.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/forschungsfoerderung/fwf-programme/start-programm">FWF START</a>: to researchers who are 2 to 8 years after PhD. They should also be applying for an ERC StG at the same time that they apply for this funding: the two programmes are indeed very similar: START is 1,2 mln € (but without overheads, so it closely correspond to the an ERC StG budget, which includes overheads) for up to six years.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/forschungsfoerderung/fwf-programme/schroedinger-programm">Schrödinger Programme</a>: it is aimed at young researchers who will develop their project between an institution abroad (for up to 2 years) and one in Austria (for up to 1 year).</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/forschungsfoerderung/fwf-programme/richter-programm">Elise-Richter Programme</a>: this is aimed at women, who already have some postdoctoral experience, to support them for six years, during which they will complete their Habilitation.</li>
            </ul>
            
         
            <h5>Other funding possibilities - not reserved to ECRs and/or abroad</h5>
            ECRs can apply also for funding open to all researchers, such as - at EU level - by being part of H2020 consortia. In Austria, the main research funding agency is the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/forschungsfoerderung/fwf-programme">FWF (Austrian Science Fund)</a>, and postdocs can apply for funding within its Individual Projects scheme, for example. In addition, there might be funding possibilities also from other bodies, such as local governments or the Austrian Academy of Sciences.
           
When considering funding for a postdoc project, it is also worth considering the situation abroad, and being aware of the various funding possibilites. For example, in the UK, there are two main research fellowships (<a href="https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships">Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowships</a> and <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships/">British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowships</a>), 
            and the British Academy offers also the <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/newton-international-fellowships/">Newton International Fellowship</a> for researchers coming from outside the UK. In addition, various universities have postdoctoral fellowships and programmes; and the UK Research Funding agencies have programmes dedicated to ECRs (e.g. <a href="https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/future-leaders-fellowships-round-6/">Future Leaders Fellowships</a>). In the Netherlands, the <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls">NWO</a> has also a series of calls, including ones reserved for early career researchers.
